# 00b-What is IR

### What is Information Retrieval?

Information Retrieval (IR) deals  with the **representation**, **storage**,  **organization of**, and **access to** information items. 

The representation and  organization of the information  items should provide the user with  easy access to the **information in which he is interested**. 

### What is Information Retrieval? Storage, Organisation and Access

> Information retrieval is defined as dealing with the “representation, storage, organization  of, and access to information items”. Explain why representation is an important part of  Information Retrieval. (17-18Q1a)

- **Storage** and **Organisation**: There are important  considerations in terms of storing documents also. They  must be organised so as to be **quickly accessible**. This is  particularly important with large document collections.  
- **Access**: The key attribute of an IR system is to allow users  to access the information in question. This should happen in a timely and efficient manner.

- The **representation** and **organization** of the information items should provide the user with easy access to the information in which he is interested. 

### Information Need: 4 Stages

1. the actual, but unexpressed need for information  (visceral need): “a vague sort of dissatisfaction ...  probably inexpressible in linguistic terms”.  
2. the conscious within-brain description of the need  (conscious need): “an ambiguous and rambling  statement”. i.e. “I know what I’m looking for but I don’t  know how to say it”.  
3. the formal statement of the question (formalised need)  
4. the question as presented to the information system  (compromised need)

### Queries

A **query** is the expression of an information need  (compromised need) that is provided to an IR system to  explain what information is required by the user.

### The Role of an IR System

> An information retrieval system does  not inform (i.e. change the  knowledge of) the user on the subject  of his inquery. It merely informs on the  existence (or non-existence) and  whereabouts of documents relating to  his request. – C. J. van Rijsbergen

- The principal function of an IR system is to give users a list of documents that are relevant to the user’s information need.  
- It makes no attempt to take a subset of the information  contained in a document and present that to the user: it is  the task of the searcher to do this.  
- With most systems, this list is ranked, with the document the  system believes to be of most relevance at the top of the list. 

### Why is Information Retrieval Important?

IR systems are vital in providing users with access to this information。

# 01b-Indexing

### Indexer step 1: Token sequence

-  Sequence (list) of pairs: (token, docID).

### Indexer step 2: Sort

- Sort this sequence by the terms  (alphabetically) and then by  the docIDs. (按首字母排序)

### Indexer step 3: Dictionary & Postings

- Split into a **dictionary** (alphabetical order of  terms) and **postings** (**ordered** list of  documents each term appears in).

- We also record the **document frequency** of  each term (the number of documents it  appears in).

### Boolean Operators

- AND: 交集
- OR: 并集
- NOT: A NOT B = (A∪B)-B

Query: **Brutus** AND **Calpurnia** AND **Caesar** **→** (**Calpurnia** AND **Brutus**) AND **Caesar**

***可以优先从最短的列表开始，因为完成最短列后，我们就可以停止了！***

### Skip Pointers

> 添加跳跃指针，跳过一部分元素

| 2→4→8→41→48→64→128  |
| ------------------- |
| 1→2→3→8→11→17→21→31 |

- 假设上下同时到**8**，上面下一个是**41**，下面下一个是**11**
- 下面的列表就可以跳过**31**，因为仍然比**41**小

### Where do we place skips?

- More skips → shorter skip spans → more likely to skip. But lots of comparisons to skip pointers. 
- Fewer skips → few pointer comparison, but then long skip spans →  few successful skips.

有一个简单的方法：对于长度为**L**的列表来说，使用**根号L**间距放置skip pointers

> 这在过去确实很有用；有了现代硬件，它可能就不会了除非你有一个基于内存的索引。
> **加载更大的帖子列表的I/O成本可能超过从内存合并更快**！

### Creating an Index

1. Split the text  into tokens  (generally words)

2. Tokens must be processed further, according to the language the text is in (more on this **NOW**).
3.  Then, we create the inverted index (反向索引).

### Token

- A **token** is an instance of a sequence of characters. In the previous  lecture we said they were similar to words, but they are not the same.

### Preprocessing

Each such token is now a candidate for storing as an index entry, after **further processing**. We refer to this as **preprocessing** as it occurs before  queries are processed by the system.

- When we store a token in an index, we call it a **term**.
-  **Note**: A term is not always a real word.

### Normalization

- We may need to “**normalise**” tokens so that they  become terms in the same form.
  - e.g. *USA↔U.S.A.*

一些常见的方法：

- 所有token变成小写
- 删除句号： *USA, U.S.A. → usa*

- 删除连词符：*anti-discrimininatory, antidiscriminatory → antidiscriminatory*

# 02b-Preprocessing: Stopwords, Stemming and  Lemmatisation

### Stopword Removal

- A **stopword** is a commonly occurring term that appears in so many documents that it **does not add to the meaning** of the document, and appear in most English texts.
  - e.g. *the, and, of, etc.*

- Stopwords can be estimated using **Zipf’s Law**.

#### **Zipf’s Law**.

- If we rank terms from the most commonly used to the least commonly-used in  a large text collection, the second term is approximately ½ as common as the  first, the third is approximately ⅓ as common as the first, etc.
- We use this to identify what terms count as stopwords in various languages.

> There is a **tradeoff** required when using stopwords.

**Some queries will become impossible if all stopwords are removed:**

- Phrases: “King of Denmark”
- Song titles, etc. “Let **it be**”, “**To be or not to be**”
- Relational queries: “Flights **to** London”

**Some solutions:**

- Don’t remove stopwords. Use all words as terms.
- Recognise when combinations of stopwordsare meaningful, and include these as terms in the index.
