# 00b-What is IR

### What is Information Retrieval?

Information Retrieval (IR) deals  with the **representation**, **storage**,  **organization of**, and **access to** information items. 

The representation and  organization of the information  items should provide the user with  easy access to the **information in which he is interested**. 

### What is Information Retrieval? Storage, Organisation and Access

> Information retrieval is defined as dealing with the “representation, storage, organization  of, and access to information items”. Explain why representation is an important part of  Information Retrieval. (17-18Q1a)

- **Storage** and **Organisation**: There are important  considerations in terms of storing documents also. They  must be organised so as to be **quickly accessible**. This is  particularly important with large document collections.  
- **Access**: The key attribute of an IR system is to allow users  to access the information in question. This should happen in a timely and efficient manner.

- The **representation** and **organization** of the information items should provide the user with easy access to the information in which he is interested. 

### Information Need: 4 Stages

1. the actual, but unexpressed need for information  (visceral need): “a vague sort of dissatisfaction ...  probably inexpressible in linguistic terms”.  
2. the conscious within-brain description of the need  (conscious need): “an ambiguous and rambling  statement”. i.e. “I know what I’m looking for but I don’t  know how to say it”.  
3. the formal statement of the question (formalised need)  
4. the question as presented to the information system  (compromised need)

### Queries

A **query** is the expression of an information need  (compromised need) that is provided to an IR system to  explain what information is required by the user.

### The Role of an IR System

> An information retrieval system does  not inform (i.e. change the  knowledge of) the user on the subject  of his inquery. It merely informs on the  existence (or non-existence) and  whereabouts of documents relating to  his request. – C. J. van Rijsbergen

- The principal function of an IR system is to give users a list of documents that are relevant to the user’s information need.  
- It makes no attempt to take a subset of the information  contained in a document and present that to the user: it is  the task of the searcher to do this.  
- With most systems, this list is ranked, with the document the  system believes to be of most relevance at the top of the list. 

### Why is Information Retrieval Important?

IR systems are vital in providing users with access to this information。
